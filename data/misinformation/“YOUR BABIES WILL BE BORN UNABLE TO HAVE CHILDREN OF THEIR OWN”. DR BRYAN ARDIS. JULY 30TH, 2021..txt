And also all pregnant women need to be where there is polyethylene Glycol 2000 and the Fizer Moderna shots. There's polysorbate 80 in the Johnson and Johnson and AstraZeneca shots, there's graphene oxide that's been determined to be inside of the Pfizer shots. You just need to know all pregnant women. If you're pregnant with a female baby, there are two trimesters in which the female bodies ovaries inside your baby will be creating all the eggs it will ever have for its whole life. The infertility that's going to be coming from this is not in this generation.

Your babies are going to be born unable to have children of their own. So you're going to have babies. They're going to come out looking normal. And then when they go to be 18, 1920 years old, they're not going to have any eggs actually get pregnant with because these chemicals in these shots are known to be toxic to the developing eggs inside of the ovaries of females. So you're going to look back and go, you know what?

It didn't cause any harm to my child. I got the vaccines when I was pregnant with you at ten years old, you're fine, 20 years old, you're fine. And then you go to get pregnant or try to have children. You never will be able to. This is a great attempt to try to sterilize and fertilize the world it appears, but every pregnant woman should be worn that they should never take these shots outside of the miscarriages that are being reported within days of the shots.

Think about the baby inside. No, no.
