state which is unconstitutional super super dangerous and that is very unlawful for a lot of reasons but they're talking about all these hospitals are overflowing with people why don't you carry a camera in one of these hospitals they're supposed to be overflowing with covered patients and show me how empty they are these chicks are in there doing tick tock dances but here's the two things that bothered me most somebody sent it to bill it'll be all right let me tell you something number one he has authorized the power of the national guard to get involved in issues of covet 19. oh i know you didn't bargain for this when you came to church but that's all good you're here now so we might as well chit-chat for a minute if you fall asleep missed some of it it'll be on right-wing watching newsweek tonight by six o'clock maybe about three o'clock i guarantee you but here's what's interesting about that we look like well yo the national guard\
should should get involved you know what bothers me more about the national guard getting involved why don't you look at section 8 of what he signed they have authorized fema y'all hearing me saying all you want is about to get hot they've authorized the tennessee department of fema to build what they call in his own authorized pages of a signature quarantine camps i ain't talking about east germany i'm talking about tennessee quarantine camps for the uninformed people that are still in refusal to be vaccinated look if that don't bother you you might as well show up at another church next week because i'm gonna keep raising cain about all this nonsense i don't care what bill lee says i don't care what fraudulent fake joe biden says i don't care what planned parenthood says i don't care what chris cromo said i don't care what gavin newsom said i don't care what nancy pelosi and her insurrectionist nonsense has to say you better wake up church you better wake up\
