>> DR.
SHIMABUKURO: Good afternoon and thank you for having me
today.
It's a pleasure to present to the group.
I will be talking about anaphylaxis following COVID-19
vaccination.
Some slides presenting are adapted from presentation at
ACIP on December 19, by doctor Tom Clark.
The first concern for anaphylaxis following COVID-19
vaccination occurred in the United Kingdom which
initiated their vaccination program just prior to the
U.
S.
initiating its vaccination program.
On December 8, the UK started vaccinating with the
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.
On December 9, the UK authorities confirmed two cases
of anaphylaxis after vaccination and prompted issued
this press release from the NHRA.
The confirmation to guidance to vaccination centers on
managing allergic reactions following COVID-19
vaccination with the Pfizer bio and tech vaccine.
As far as the U.
S.
program, ACIP considered anaphylaxis risk during
deliberations on the Pfizer biotech COVID-19 vaccine
during December 11 and 12 meeting.
It issued interim recommendations for the use of the
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and shortly thereafter,
CDC issued interim consideration preparing for the
potential management of anaphylaxis at COVID-19 sites.
At a ACIP meeting on December 19 and 20, CDC gave
updates on anaphylaxis in the U.
S.
following COVID-19 vaccination.
In this presentation, CDC identified six case reports
of anaphylaxis following the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine
that met the Brighton Collaboration criteria through
anaphylaxis.
All cases occurred within the recommended observation
window and promptly treated.
All suspected cases were notified through VAERS or CDC
notification processes.
At that time, December 19, 272,001 process of Pfizer
BioNTech were administered and currently over 2 million doses of
the Pfizer vaccine have been administered.
CDC actions to address these reports of anaphylaxis
include close coordination with FDA on safety
monitoring.
ConContinued enhanced monitoring for anaphylaxis cases
through the vaccine adverse event reporting system and
involes rapid identification and follow-up on suspected
anaphylaxis cases.
Also, case reviews and consultation with allergy,
immunology experts to provide guidance for persons
following anaphylaxis to COVID-19 vaccine.
I will say since the December 19 presentation, CDC and
FDA through monitoring and VARES have continued to
identify additional cases of anaphylaxis occurring
following Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination.
I want to emphasize the role of healthcare providers
and safety monitoring, specifically for monitoring for
anaphylaxis.
That primarily involves recognizing, responding, and reporting
anaphylaxis cases following COVID-19 vaccination to VA
RES and reporting reporting adverse events to VAERS in accordance with the FDA Emergency Use Authorization reporting requirements and CDC guidance. I will also mention participation in CDCâ€™s v-safe program both for yourself
when you get vaccinated and encouraging patients to
participate and communicating with patients on vaccine
safety.
VAERS is the nation's early warning system for vaccine safety
and provides the quickest information on adverse events
and quickest information to allow us to characterize
the safety profile of newly authorized vaccines when
they are recommended in the population.
It is co-managed by CDC and FDA and spontaneous report
or passive surveillance system.
It depends on individuals to send reports to VAERS.
Anyone can send reports to VAERS, but healthcare
provider reports are particularly valuable because we
believe the level of detail in the clinical information
provided from healthcare providers in these reports is
particular useful for CDC and FDA.
The process for reporting adverse events to VAERS is an
online process.
Go to the VAERS website at VAERS.HHS.
gov and on the page you see here, there are links on
the left-hand corner.
Click on the link and it takes you to the electronic or
online reporting form, and you can fill out the report,
click submit, and you get notifications that you
successfully completed the report.
For help, there is an 800-number and also an
information email.
If you want to watch video instructions on submitting
VAERS reports, you can go to the YouTube link and view
videos that have been created by CDC and FDA.
I mentioned V safe and I will mention again.
V safe is a active monitoring system that was stood up
by CDC just for COVID-19 vaccination.
These are some resources on the program.
Right now, v-save involves manual registration process
that patients have to register.
What I show on the right-hand side is a screenshot of
the v-safe information sheet.
The full sheet has a URL and a QR code you can scan to
take you to the registration site.
Patients have to enter a few data elements and
register.
Once you are in the system, CDC begins sending text
messages that involve health chickens.
These messages have links to web surveys where you can
report on post vaccination experiences.
We ask that healthcare providers help us get as many
people to use v-safe as possible and that involves
giving one page information sheet to patients at the
time of vaccination, or posting information in the
clinic area, or area where individuals get vaccination
posting that so individuals have access to the URL code
and scannable QR code.
Also, counseling patients on the importance of
enrolling in v-safe can be quick in saying this is what
the program is and we encourage you to participate.
We created this electronic version of the information
sheet, as well as promotional material for distribution
to the public health and partners.
I just want to wrap up with reference slide on
information on how to report to VAERS.
The most important thing that healthcare providers can
do both to help us monitor for anaphylaxis and allergic
reactions, and help us monitor vaccine safety in
general, is to report adverse events to VAERS and
report them as quickly after they happen as possible,
and be as complete on the VAERS report as possible.
I have some resources in general CDC vaccine safety
information.
Thank you.
>>:: Thank you.
This is Dr.
Sarah Mbaeyi and I will go through updates to CDC's
guidance around contraindications and precautions to mRNA
COVID-19 vaccines.
>> DR.
MBAEYI: Although the investigation into these reports
are ongoing, persons with history of immediate allergic
reaction of any severity to previous dose of mRNA
COVID-19 vaccine might be at greater risk for
anaphylaxis upon re-exposure to either of the current
authorized vaccines.
CDC updated guidance around contraindications and
precautions to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.
This guidance was developed in consultation with
external experts and allergy immunology and vaccine
safety CDC clinical immunization safety assessment
project, as well as American Academy of Allergy, Asthma,
and Immunology.
These updated recommendations are included in the CDC
interim clinical consideration for use of mRNA COVID-19
vaccines currently authorized in the United States.
This can be accessed in the link at the bottom of the
slide.
I will mention the updated version will be going live
right after this call.
The current version in the link now will be updated by
about 3 PM.
These updated recommendations apply to both Pfizer and
Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.
This guidance may change as further information becomes
available.
For the purpose of this guidance, reaction to vaccine
or medication is defined as any hypersensitivity
related signs or symptoms such as urticaria,
angioedema, respiratory distress such as wheezing or stridor, or
anaphylaxis that occurs within four hours following
administration.
CDC considers history of the following to be
contraindication too vaccination with both Pfizer-BioNTech
and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.
Severe's allergic reaction such as anaphylaxis after
previous dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or any
component, immediate allergic reaction of any severity
to previous dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, or any
component including polyethylene glycol or PEG and
immediate allergic reaction of any severity to
polysorbate due to cross reaction hypersensitivity
between the vaccine PEG and polysorbate.
Persons with immediate allergic reaction to the first
dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine should not receive
additional doses of either of the mRNA COVID-19
vaccines because the two authorized vaccines contain
ingredients in common.
I will also mentioned that these persons should not
receive mRNA COVID-19 vaccination at this time unless
they have been evaluated by an allergist immunologist
and determined the person can safely receive the
vaccine such as vaccination under observation or
settings with advanced medical care available.
Let's review the ingredients included in these
vaccines.
Both vaccines consist of nucleoside modified mRNA
encoding viral spike of SARS CoV-2.
In addition, both contain four different lipids, some
of which are in common between the two vaccines as well
as salt, sugars and buffers.
I just wanted to highlight that polyethylene glycol or
PEG is component of both vaccines.
PEG is primary ingredient in osmotic laxatives and oral
bowel preparations for colonoscopy procedures and an
active ingredient or excipient in many medications and
use in process called pegylation to improve therapeutic
activity of some including certain chemotherapy.
Additionally as I mentioned before, cross-reactive
hypersensitivity between PEG and polysorbate which are
included as recipient in some vaccines and other
therapeutic agents can occur.
Resources for determining whether medications contains
PEG, e.
g.
Derivative or polysorbate are included on the footnote
on the slide.
As mentioned, persons with immediate allergic reaction
to the first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine should not
receive additional doses of either of the mRNA COVID-19
vaccines.
It is important for providers to determine whether
reactions reported following vaccination are consistent
with immediate allergic reactions which would indicate
contraindication to additional vaccine doses, versus
other reactions commonly observed following vaccination
such as as a vasovagal reaction or post-vaccination
side effects which are not contraindications to the
second dose.
The following table of signs and symptoms is meant to
serve as resource for clinicians but may not be
exhaustive and patients may not have all signs or
symptoms.
Providers should use clinical judgment when assessing
patients to determine diagnosis and management.
I will go through each category in the next slide.
I will start with immediate allergic reactions
including anaphylaxis.
Most immediate allergic reactions occur within 15 to 30
minutes of vaccination although some may be delayed.
Patients with anaphylaxis may report feelings of
impending doom and approximately 90% of patients
present with skin findings such as proritus, urticaria, flushing
or angioedema which can be helpful from allergic to
other reactions.
Patients mat have confusion, disorientation, dizziness,
weakness or loss of consciousness.
They may also explains respiratory symptoms such as
shortness of breath, wheezing, bronchospasm stridor or
hypoxia and may have gastrointestinal such as nausea,
vomiting, abdominal cramps, or diarrhea.
These people should not receive the second dose of mRNA
COVID-19 vaccine at this time.
We will get into this in later slides but anaphylaxis
is medical emergency that requires prompt treatment
with epinephrine.
In terms of vasovagal reaction, most occur within 15
minutes of vaccination.
Patients may report feeling warm or cold, have pallor,
diaphoresis, clammy skin, or sensation of facial warmth.
They may have dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope after prodromal
symptoms, weakness, changes in vision and hearing.
They may had elevated respiratory rate especially if
symptoms are accompanied by anxiety.
They may have hypertension or bradycardia during
syncope event.
They may have nausea or vomiting.
Persons with vasovagal reaction to the first dose
should receive the second dose, the provider should
take appropriate measures in these patients to prevent
injuries if patients become weak busy or lose
consciousness.
They should be seated or lying down during vaccination.
We will get into this but they will be monitored for 15
minutes after vaccination which will help decrease
injury if they faint.
Finally, I will go through vaccine side effects both local and
systemic.
Local and systemic side effects following vaccination
are common and expected.
Most patients will have them.
Onset of symptoms occur a median of 1 to 3 days after vaccination,
with most occurring the day after vaccination, which
helps distinguish reactions from allergic and vasovagal
reactions which have rapid onset following vaccination.
Vaccinated persons may develop fever, chills or fatigue
as well as pain, erythema or swelling at injection site, and lymphadenopathy.
They may develop headaches.
Vomiting and diarrhea may occur but not very
frequently.
In addition, vaccinated persons may develop myalgia and
arthralgia.
These symptoms generally resolved within 1 to 2 days with an
onset.
People with systemic side effects following the first
dose should receive the second dose.
They can be counseled to take acetaminophen or
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the event
symptoms develop after vaccination.
I will review precautions to mRNA vaccinations.
CDC considers history of reaction to any vaccine or
injectable therapy that is intramuscular, intravenous
or subcutaneous vaccines or therapies not related to component of mRNA COVID-19
vaccines or polysorbate as precaution but not
contraindication to vaccination for both Pfizer-BioNTech
and Moderna vaccines.
These persons should be counseled about unknown risk of
developing severe allergic reaction and balance risks
against benefit of vaccination.
Deferral vaccination and/or consultation with allergist
immunologist may be considered until further
information on the risk of anaphylaxis is available.
The following considerations can be used to help
providers conduct risk assessment for mRNA COVID-19
vaccination in these individuals.
Risk of exposure to SARS CoV-2, for example because of
residence in congregate setting such as long-term care
facility or occupation, risk of severe disease or death
due to COVID-19 because of age, underlying medical
conditions.
Whether the patient has previously been infected with
SARS CoV-2 and if so, how long ago?
And of note, vaccinations are recommended for persons with
history of COVID-19.
However, because reinfection is uncommon in the 90 days
following infection, persons with precaution to
vaccination and recent SARS CoV-2 infection, may choose
to defer vaccination until further information is known
about the risk of anaphylaxis following vaccination.
The unknown risk of anaphylaxis following
mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in persons with history of
immediate allergic reaction to other vaccines or
injectable therapies and
finally, ability of patient to be vaccinated in
settings where appropriate medical care is immediately
available for anaphylaxis.
Allergic reactions including severe allergic reactions
that are not related to vaccines injectable therapies,
components of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, or polysorbate
such as food, pet, venom, environment allergies, or
allergies to medications including oral equivalent of
injectable medications are not contraindication or
precaution to vaccination with either mRNA COVID-19
vaccine.
The vile stoppers of these mRNA vaccines are not made
with natural rubber latex.
There is no contraindication or precaution to vaccination for
persons with latex allergy.
In addition, as the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines do not contain eggs or
gelatin, persons with allergies to the substances do
not have contraindication or precaution to vaccination.
CDC recommends that vaccine providers observe all
persons after vaccination regardless of allergic
history.
Those with precaution to vaccination or history of
anaphylaxis due to any cause should be observed for 30
minutes.
All other persons should be observed for at least 15
minutes after vaccination to monitor for immediate
adverse reactions.
To put it all together, there are three categories of
persons with history of allergic reactions that may
present for mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.
Those who may proceed with vaccination are included in
the green box.
These are persons with histories of allergies unrelated
to component of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.
Other vaccines or injectable therapies.
Persons with these allergies who have history of
anaphylaxis to due to any cause, should be observed for
30 minutes, and all other persons should be observed
for 15 minutes.
Persons with history of any immediate allergic reaction
to vaccines or injectable therapies except those
related to component of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or
polysorbate have precaution -- precaution shown in the
yellow box.
Risk assessment should be conducted in these persons.
Deferral of vaccination and/or referral to allergist
immunologist may be considered.
If these persons are vaccinated, they should be
observed for 30 minutes.
In the red box are persons whom vaccination is
contraindication.
This includes persons with history of severe allergic
reaction after previous dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine
or any component, immediate allergic reaction of any
severity to previous dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or
any component.
Or immediate allergic reaction of any severity --
immediate reaction to polysorbate.
They should not receive mRNA vaccination at this time
unless they have been evaluated by allergist
immunologist and determined the person can safely
receive the vaccine for example under observation or
setting with advanced medical care available.
CDC developed additional tools that providers can use
at the vaccination site to help identify persons with
contraindications or precautions to vaccination
including pre-vaccination checklist and further
additional information in the form of facts sheet.
CDC also developed interim considerations for preparing
potential management of anaphylaxis at COVID-19
vaccination sites.
These considerations include information on early
recognition of anaphylaxis, medications and supplies
needed for the assessment and management of
anaphylaxis, how to manage anaphylaxis at the
vaccination site, patient counseling and reporting of
anaphylaxis.
The key take-home messages from these guidances are
early recognition of anaphylaxis symptoms, prompt
treatment with epinephrine, and activation of emergency
medical services.
COVID-19 vaccines will likely be administered in wide
variety of clinical settings including hospitals,
long-term care facilities, outpatient medical offices,
pharmacies, mass vaccination sites and curbside or drive-thru
sites.
These settings differ in terms of usual on hand human
and material resources to manage anaphylaxis.
In the guidance we have included a list of medication supplies
that are important for evaluating and managing
anaphylaxis and recommended for COVID-19 vaccination
sites.
We divided them into supplies that should be available
at all sites at the minimum requirements to assess and
manage anaphylaxis as well as other medications and
supplies helpful to include where feasible.
All sites should have epinephrine and H1 antihistamines,
a blood pressure cuff, stethoscope, and timing
device to assess pulse.
Finally, clinical immunization safety assessment
COVIDvax project is an additional resource.
Healthcare personnel or health departments in the
United States can request consultation are complex
COVID-19 vaccine safety question about an individual
patient residing in the United States that is not
readily addressed by CDC guidance.
Information on how to request consultation can be found
at the link level.
That concludes my portion of the talk.
Thank you.
>>:: Presenters, thank you for providing our audience
with such critical information.
We will now go into the Q&A session.
You may submit questions to Zoom by clicking the Q&A
button at the bottom of your screen and then type in
your question.
The first question asks can people feel confident that
the COVID-19 vaccines are safe?
>> DR.
MBAEYI: Tom, do you want me to take that?
>> DR.
SHIMABUKURO: Yes, that would be great.
>> DR.
MBAEYI: Sure.
Yes, people can be assured that the COVID-19 vaccines
are safe.
Safety has been a number one priority in the
development and approval of these vaccines and have
gone through all the same safety tests and meet all
safety standards as other vaccines.
The U.
S.
Food and Drug Administration has issued an emergency
use authorization for these vaccines as everyone on
this call is aware.
In order for that to be issued, there has to be
adequate information on not only safety and
effectiveness of vaccine, but manufacturing, quality
and consistency, as well as making determination that
the known and potential benefits outweigh the risk of
the vaccine.
As Tom alluded to in his talk, there are a whole host
of safety monitoring systems in the United States that
will be used to rigorously continue to assess the
safety of the vaccines.
>>:: Thank you.
Our next question asks how come there were no cases of
severe allergic reactions like anaphylaxis reported in
the clinical trials of these vaccines?
>> DR.
MBAEYI: I can start.
I think there are a couple reasons.
One thing is to recognize in the clinical trials were
large Phase 3 trials, but depending on how rare the
rate of anaphylaxis is after the people in the general
population, it may be too rare of an outcome to be
observed in the clinical trial.
I think that is one reason.
Another reason is people were not eligible for the
clinical trials if they had previous history of
anaphylaxis to vaccines.
If there are people out there more prone to having
anaphylaxis to vaccines, they may not have been
eligible.
The third potential reason and again, speculation, is
people who have history of allergic reactions or
history of anaphylaxis to other medications or
vaccines, they may not be the type of people willing to
participate in clinical trials.
Because they have those medical underlying histories.
They make self-selected themselves out of
participation.
Those are potential reasons.
>> DR.
SHIMABUKURO: Even though there has been quite awareness
of the cases of anaphylaxis reported, after vaccination
these are still very rare events.
Even in large clinical trials where 15 or 20,000
individuals are getting vaccinated, that is still
relatively small number of individuals to pick up very
rare event like anaphylaxis following immunization.
>>:: Thank you.
The next question asks what do you mean by immediate
allergic reaction?
>> DR.
MBAEYI: I will take this question.
Immediate allergic reaction, we are defining this for
the purposes of our guidance.
We are defining this as a hypersensitivity type
reaction such as development of hives, itching, or mouth
swelling, facial swelling.
And guidance we call that cardio, anaphylaxis and those
types of hypersensitivity symptoms that develop within
four hours of administration of vaccine.
The goal is to distinguish these types of people who are likely to
truly be having an allergic reaction following
vaccination based on temporal association as well as
signs and symptoms.
From those people that might develop rash for some
reason one week later or days later and putting those
boundaries on the definitions so clinicians who are
evaluating patients who come in and say I developed a
rash after vaccination so they can help determine the
likelihood that those patients had of signs and
symptoms due to allergic reaction and not something
else.
That is the definition we are using.
>>:: Thank you.
The next question asks why was the guidance about who
should not get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccination
change?
>> DR.
MBAEYI: Great question.
This guidance has been updated primarily because
starting in a few days, people who got the first dose
will be eligible to receive the second dose.
We felt that providers really needed more guidance on
how to address patients who may have had an allergic
reaction after the first dose, and how to manage for
the second dose.
I think we have continued the reports of anaphylaxis
are under investigation as has been described, but we
are continuing to learn more about how frequently this
may be happening.
I think we wanted to make sure we are continuously
revaluing guidance to make sure it's based on the best
available evidence and felt this was the right time to do it so
providers had more information once people started to
come in for the second dose of vaccines.
>>:: Thank you.
What steps will CDC take if you find potential safety
issues with the vaccines?
>> DR.
MBAEYI: This is Tom.
If we do detect potential safety issue, one of the
first things we will do is working with partners to
include the Food and Drug Administration, and other
partners to collaborate and work on rapidly assessing
the potential safety issue.
There are many safety monitoring systems that CDC and
FDA and other partners use.
We can look in other systems and do other methods, and
do additional analysis in the system that detected
potential safety problem.
We also have groups at CDC that to you reviews of
individual cases, and clinical research as well.
Lastly, I will mention we will work with our Federal
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to present
the data and communicate to the public in a timely and c
transparent manner.
>>:: Thank you.
How does risk of severe allergic reaction after getting
a Pfizer vaccine versus Moderna vaccine compare to the risk of a severe
reaction after other recommended vaccines?
>> DR.
SHIMABUKURO: This is Tom and I will take this question.
I think it's early right now.
We have only have been vaccinated for a few weeks and
still in the process of assessing the situation and
analyzing the data.
What I can say is based on the information we have
right now, severe allergic reaction after COVID-19 is a
rare event.
COVID-19 can be a very serious disease in some segments
of the population.
Vaccination is an important tool that we can use to get
the pandemic under control.
I think the message is our safety systems rapidly
detected these reports of anaphylaxis, and CDC and FDA
are in the process of rapidly assessing this.
It is early and we will continue to communicate with
the public and with healthcare providers and keep them
informed in Hamlet -- timely manner.
>>:: Thank you.
Can you please reiterate who should not get the Pfizer
or Moderna vaccines?
>> DR.
MBAEYI: This is Sarah and I can take that one.
The people who should not get either of the COVID-19
vaccines are those people that have had severe allergic
reaction such as anaphylaxis after previous dose of
mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or any component.
Those people that have had immediate allergic reaction
of any severity to previous dose in the vaccine or any
component, and those who have had immediate allergic
reaction of any severity to polysorbate.
Polysorbate is not an ingredient in the vaccine, but
cross-reactive hypersensitivity between these
polysorbate and polyethylene glycol which is component
has been observed.
Until we know more and the investigation reveals more,
that is also contraindication to vaccination.
>>:: Thank you.
What can you tell about the safety of vaccinating
people with prior history of COVID-19 infection with
COVID-19 vaccines?
>> DR.
SHIMABUKURO: This is Tom.
I can take a crack at that I may ask Sara to step in if
she has better information on the clinical trial.
I do not believe prior history of COVID-19 infection
was an exclusion criteria for the clinical trial.
There were individuals who had prior history of
infection included in the trials and they did not
observe any safety signals in those individuals.
>>:: --
>> DR.
MBAEYI: I was going to say the same thing; there was
testing done to look for evidence of prior infection in
people enrolled in the clinical trial.
There were people in the clinical trials that have
evidence that they had previous infection as Tom said,
there was not any safety concerns identified.
>>:: Thank you.
What about people with allergies to other things like
pets, food, can they get COVID-19 vaccines?
>> DR.
MBAEYI: This is Sarah and I can take that.
Yes, they can get vaccinations.
Those people are included in that green box that I
showed who can proceed with vaccination.
That includes food, environmental allergies, pet
allergies, insect or bee sting allergies.
They can all get the vaccination and have no
precautions or contraindications.
The only thing we say about this group of people with
those allergies is if they have had anaphylaxis due to
those pet food allergies, they should be observed for
30 minutes instead of 15.
--
>>:: For those looking for the slides material, we
will share the web link where you can find both slides
as well as archived materials towards the end of the
call.
What are the possible side effects of these vaccines?
>> DR.
MBAEYI: I can take that one.
In terms of normal typical vaccine side effects, for
both vaccines, people can have things like sore arm or
redness around injection site, swelling around site and
these are common.
The majority of people have those types of symptoms.
They last typically one day or two.
They are pretty minor and for most people it doesn't
cause any issues at all in terms of being able to do
what they need to during the day.
Some people will have those local symptoms.
Some people will have things like fever, chills, muscle
ache, headache, those systemic symptoms following
vaccination.
In most people, it's pretty mild.
They last one day or two and go away.
>>:: Thank you.
We have questions about VAERS.
Who can report reactions to VAERS and who should report
reactions to VAERS?
>> DR.
SHIMABUKURO: This is Tom.
Anyone can report suspected adverse reaction to VAERS.
That includes patients, parents, healthcare providers,
caregivers.
Anyone can report suspected adverse reaction to VAERS.
We accept all reports without making any judgments on
whether it is biologically plausible if the vaccine
could have caused the adverse reaction, or clinically
serious.
We accept reports without judging and they will get
into the database and analyzed.
We specifically depend on healthcare providers to
report to VAERS.
We think healthcare providers are uniquely positioned
to support and help us monitor vaccine safety and have
access to information that will make the reports both
timely and complete.
I think anyone who experiences an adverse event
following immunization, should report, even if it's not
completely clear as the vaccine caused the adverse
event.
That includes all members of the public, but especially
healthcare providers who are partners and safety
monitoring.
>>:: Are there reactions that healthcare providers are
required to report to VAERS?
>> DR.
SHIMABUKURO: Currently under the FDA emergency use
authorization, healthcare providers are required to
report certain adverse events after COVID-19
vaccination.
Under the EUA, those include administration errors,
whether associated with adverse events or not, severe
COVID-19 illness and that is defined as COVID-19
illness resulting in hospitalization.
Serious adverse events regardless of causality.
The serious adverse event -- events follow the
regulatory definition.
That is death, life-threatening adverse event and
inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of
hospitalization.
Speech of significant or persistent incapacity, general
anomaly or birth defect and also cases of multisystem
inflammatory syndrome.
In addition to reporting requirements under the
emergency use authorization, CDC encourages healthcare
providers to report any clinically significantly
adverse event following vaccination to VAERS, even if
they are unsure if the vaccination caused the adverse event, and
clinically significant is subjective.
We are relying on healthcare providers to use clinical
judgment on what they think is an important adverse
event to report.
>>:: Thank you.
The next question asks if I had an allergic reaction to
my vaccine, should I get a different COVID-19 vaccine
for my second dose?
>> DR.
MBAEYI: I can take that question.
If somebody had an allergic reaction to the first dose
of the mRNA vaccine either Pfizer or Moderna, we
recommend they do not get a second dose of either of
those two vaccines.
If additional vaccine products become available in the
United States that are different or we don't have the
same concerns for, you will have to assess guidance at
future times.
In terms of the two vaccines currently authorized in
the united states, if you have an allergic reaction to
one, we are saying you should not get the second dose
of the other vaccine.
>>:: Thank you.
Which other vaccines include polyethylene glycol or
other shared components of the COVID-19 vaccines?
>> DR.
MBAEYI: I can take that.
There are no other vaccines that contain polyethylene
glycol.
The other shared components of these two vaccines,
there are other debates like things like cholesterol,
other salts and sugars that are not thought to be large
concern as being -- causing allergic reaction.
There are no other vaccines in particular that have
PEG.
>>:: Thank you.
Another question about VAERS.
How do I report to VAERS?
>> DR.
SHIMABUKURO: I had quite a bit of
information in my presentation on how to report to
VAERS with links and instructional material.
VAERS is a fully online electronic reporting process.
If you feel like your patient had an adverse event
following unitization, you want to report and you
simply go to the website,
VAERS.hhs.gov
and click on the link to report adverse events.
It will take you to an online reporting form which you
can fill in.
You have to fill that in one sitting and hit submit.
If you cannot do it all in one sitting, you can
download fillable PDF and fill out the PDF and upload
later at your convenience.
All reporting is done online on the VAERS website.
>>:: Thank you.
Can you please repeat the components of the Pfizer and
Moderna COVID-19 vaccines?
>> DR.
MBAEYI: Both vaccines contain mRNA that is encoding for
the spike protein of SARS CoV-2.
Both contain four different lipids that forms the lipid
nano particle or nano layer which helps protect the
mRNA from degrading too quickly once it enters the
body.
Both contain the four different lipids.
One of them as I mentioned before, is PEG.
They do contain other lipids in common as well.
The rest of ingredients are salts, sugars, buffers.
There are tables in the guidance were you can see the
details, but those are the components.
MRNA, lipids, salts, sugars and buffers.
Neither vaccines contain preservatives, eggs, or
anything like that.
>>:: Thank you.
For the audience looking for information on things like
components of the vaccines that were shared in the
table, as well as more information on VAERS, we will
have that information in the slides posted on this COCA
webpage which we will share the link after this Q&A
session.
The next question asks why is polyethylene glycol a
concern in these vaccines?
>> DR.
MBAEYI: I will take that.
I just want to preface by saying no one really knows if
polyethylene glycol is the culprit.
It has not been determined.
Everything is still under investigation.
The reason why polyethylene glycol has been singled
out, I think is because most of the other vaccine
ingredients are not thought to be of concern.
These are things that are in our bodies and a lot of
other things.
The other ingredients just the possibility is low that
they could be causing something like this.
Polyethylene glycol is in a lot of medications.
It's not just used in medications in either but used
for a lot of other purposes.
It is thought that severe allergic reaction to
polyethylene glycol is rare.
There is not many reported in literature, but it is
something that experts feel it might be
underrecognized.
It is a topic of interest that people are
looking into more.
>>:: Thank you.
How long should people wait after getting their
COVID-19 vaccine for they leave the location of
vaccination?
>> DR.
MBAEYI: It really depends on that person's history.
I will start by saying that our guidance recommends
that all persons have an observation period regardless
of whether that person has any history of allergies.
There is an observation period for all people.
For people who have had anaphylaxis due to any recent,
it's recommended they wait 30 minutes.
For people in that precaution category of vaccines,
people that have had immediate allergic reaction of any
severity to vaccines or injectable therapy, those
people are recommended to be observed for 30 minutes.
For all other persons, it's recommended that they have
15 minute observation period.
We do state and guidance that if somebody feels they
are developing symptoms of allergic reaction after they
have done the 15 or 30 minutes and have left
vaccination site, if they feel like they are developing
signs of allergic reaction, they should seek immediate
medical care.
>>:: Thank you.
What are other ways CDC is monitoring safety of these
COVID-19 vaccines?
>> DR.
SHIMABUKURO: This is Tom.
. I mentioned two systems, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) that anyone can participate in and the v-safe which is more patient-centered. CDC also has a system called the Vaccine Safety Data Link which uses electronic health record data and health record data form large health plans
to do surveillance and safety monitoring in a covered population of insurers and this is different than the VAERS in that we have near-complete information on all individuals compared to partial information on VAERS and it allows us to assess risk and monitor safety in real-time weekly, as the data comes in. Our colleagues at the Food and Drug Administration also use the Medicare data to do a similar type of analysis where they do a real-time analysis, safety monitoring as the data comes in and have additional systems that they work with and they have other federal partners that have systems that are spontaneous reporting like VAERS and electronic health record-based systems that they do monitoring in. This is important because if you detect a safety problem in one system it is often helpful to validate it in another system. It is important to have multiple complementary safety systems that work together that allow us to rapidly detect possible safety problems.
COMMANDER KHAN: Thank you. Our last question asks, how do I find out what adverse vaccine events have been reported to VAERS?
The best way to get information on adverse and safety in general is to tune into the
advisory committee on immunization practices meetings
when there is safety data presented.
The immunization safety officer routinely presents
safety data at these ACIPmeetings in public forums and
safety is discussed.
Specifically for VAERS, there is public data available.
This is data stripped of personally identifying
information and other information, sensitive
information that allows traced back to individual
patients.
That is available both on the VAERS website, and what
our research database, large excel files.
There is also search tool on the CDC website called
Wonder, that allows individuals, anyone can go in there
and access the VAERS data through the CDC wonder
platform.
