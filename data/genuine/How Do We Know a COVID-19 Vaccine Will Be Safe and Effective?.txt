The fundamental way
that we test the safety and efficacy of vaccines is by conducting a clinical trial.
And so volunteers are given the vaccine—
some of those volunteers receive a placebo—and comparisons are made
as well as rigorous safety monitoring to make sure that we understand
any kind of side effects from the vaccine or safety issues.
So, I think once these clinical trials conclude
and the regulatory agencies and scientists examine the data;
we will be confident that we have information about the safety and
efficacy of the different types of vaccines.
